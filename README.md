# Design-Patterns
Few Exercises where I applied 'Design Patterns' and refactored code in Ruby

**1. Template and Strategy patterns**
<br/>Problem statement :  'Problem' folder models a game where an oracle thinks of a number in a certain range and each participant makes a number of guesses to find out what the number is. After each guess, the oracle tells the participant if the are correct or not, and if not, whether their guess was too big to too small. The Participant class has 4 play methods representing 4 different strategies: random guessing, linear search, smarter random guessing and binary search. Study the code of the Participant class. Apply design patterns.
